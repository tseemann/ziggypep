Data sets
Phobius was trained on 4 different types of proteins. The proteins of each type was further divided into 10 different cross validation sets named:

Transmembrane proteins with signal peptides: m[0-9].faa
Transmembrane proteins without signal peptides: t[0-9].faa
Non-transmembrane proteins with signal peptides: s[0-9].faa
Non-transmembrane proteins without signal peptides: g[0-9].faa
